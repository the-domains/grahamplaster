His first million came from a simple idea, trademarking a scream. Conservatives called it pornographic and disgusting; liberals called it capitalistic, cliché, a laugh track; but couples continued to request it as the soundtrack of choice for their birthing experiences. But I must apologize. I am getting ahead of myself. You see, Aiden played with electric cars as a child. Indeed, he was fascinated by them and as an adolescent would pore over the car zines on his iPad, learning every detail of the industry. As a teen he began his own electric car video blog in which he did 45 second summaries of the most recent innovations in electric car tech. After one of his videos covering electric SUVs went viral, he caught the attention of Vedra Industries who offered him a deal right out of high school to be the official vlog for their new, all-electric sport utility vehicle, the Vedra Climber. Aiden’s family, not being wealthy, encouraged him to take the offer, which he did without hesitation. So Aiden skipped college and went straight to work from home, doing what he loved in a vlogging studio funded by Vedra. The aha moment came when he began focusing on the cottage industry of trademarked engine noises. Ever since the landmark court case in which Valetti Auto had been forced to pay millions in settlements to cover up the tragedy of the silent Valetti, electric car manufacturers had turned to musicians, sound effects masters and voice actors to create sound profiles for their vehicles that would meet a number of human needs. Among them was of course safety, but no one really wanted a siren on every vehicle. Traditionalists love a the throaty sound of an engine, and most settled on some form of this sound for their cars. There were some creative interpretations that were publicly acceptable in the same fashion, perhaps, that creative cell phone ring tones and car horns had been tolerated in the past. And thanks to new technologies in sound trademarking, many small time sound creators were effectively making a fortune off of just one good track. Right about that time there was also a breakthrough in home 3D printing technologies. People had been printing prostheses, prescription and illegal drugs, car parts, you name it, for quite some time. The new frontier in 3D printing was in introducing new “inks” and dimensions. It really wasn’t much of a leap for Dr. Jim Phelps, of Johns Hopkins, to merge in vitro fertilization science with 3D printing to create what he dubbed the synthetic birthing canal. This “SBC” was initially seen by some as a step too far towards playing God. And yet, there was a tremendous market for it. For one, risk to the child and mother was infinitesimal. By contrast, traditional birth carried with it all sorts of risks that eventually would become tantamount to child or spouse abuse to even consider. If a mother or father mentioned at a garden party that they were considering traditional birth, they could anticipate awkward looks and in certain regions, sometimes whispered slurs of “baby killer”. Traditional births were therefore done in secret with the help of religious communities who specialized in that sort of thing. An additional benefit of the new technology is that it enabled couples to extend gestation time for up to 21 months and thus meet legal requirements for a termination of pregnancy much later than was traditionally allowed. Women’s rights groups hailed this as an advancement, and anti-abortion groups called it infanticide. The SBC also came with attachments which allowed for a couple or group to “plug in” for a procreation experience. This option spawned a whole new area of obsession for some who saw the impregnation experience as something that could or should be shared by a community. Some models of the SBC could be worn in stylish front or back carriers so that the anticipated birth could be celebrated with others. Like the electric car, innovation was opening up new ways of sharing human experiences, and in some cases people still wanted to have something of the past included. Aiden anticipated, rightly, as he saw the technology develop, that there would be a market for a traditional human sound experience with the SBC. A silent birth, to him, sounded just as unsettling as a silent sports car. What most of them would want, he imagined, was not the actual sounds of birth, at least not at first. They would want some idealized version. It could probably be sampled from real birth sounds, but would need to be reimagined and sanitized, by someone untainted by the actual experience of having done it, by someone who could imagine the perfect birth experience. Aiden’s first foray into the idea of creating a birthing soundtrack required visits to a few of the aforementioned religious communes, where he sampled sounds from 72 births over the course of 15 months. He was horrified at what he saw. The long hours of groaning, panting, pleading, and weeping at once turned his stomach and rocked his emotions. It changed him. It also changed his idea of what birth should be. Real birth was an experience so far removed from the modern world, where suffering and waiting had been nearly eliminated. Women in these communes sometimes chose to undergo traditional practices of “laboring”, a word that had become arcane to common language. After some manipulation, he came up with what he thought was the right combination of anticipation leading to desperation, turning to agony, ending in joy. It was created in blissful ignorance, but somehow managed to land directly on the bulls-eye of what people wanted. Couples would go in for their birth consult and be offered a catalogues of potential tracks to choose from, only to say in unison – “Aiden” which was slang for birth track 45 in the standard birth sound library. I am sorry to say that this is where we leave off for lesson three… I will see you again on Thursday at one pm for our next installment of “the history of technology” “vis-à-vis” … and yet “via” technology. Please pardon my silliness… I have a bit of a thing for good old fashioned words. Ever heard the word “new-fangled”? I love that one! See you soon Adam! The tweed and elbow pad clad tutor on the other end of the call visibly shook with a chuckle just a bit before the screen indicated he had hung up. “Dad?...” Adam leaned back in his chair and looked to his left to peer through an open door and two walls of glass to see his father’s office on the other side of the house. He touched the screen of the wall in front of him. “Dad?” Aiden answered the call. “What’s up Adam?” Adam pushed back from his desk and swiveled to look across the house. His father had done the same. They could see each other, about 50 feet apart across an open space, in separate glass rooms; and with the call on, they could hear each other through the house speakers almost more clearly than if they were in the same room. “I just finished lesson three of HOT101 and they were talking about you. I thought I knew all this stuff already, but it sounds weird hearing it said like in one story, you know?” “What do you mean?” Aiden’s head cocked to the side a bit. Adam swiveled back to his desk so he could see his dad’s face on the screen. “I just mean… I know the reasons why you said you did it, and more, because we’ve talked about it before. Professor Lawrence seems to do a pretty good job, I think, of getting some of the important stuff in there. He said you were horrified, though. Was that right? Seems kinda strong” “Horrified? At what?” Aiden asked flatly. He already knew what Adam might say and anticipated that this conversation would require more energy than his workday should allow. He glanced away from his screen at his phone which was buzzing on his knee with incoming tweets. “At real birth.” Adam felt himself beginning to sweat. He hadn’t really wanted to talk about it with his dad, but curiosity always seemed to get the better of him when opportunities presented themselves. “Why did you and mom have me natural?” If it was so horrible, why did you put her through that? I could have died, right?” “Thank God you didn’t and thank God she didn’t.” Aiden looked into the screen at his son’s eyes. “Come on over here. Let’s grab a sandwich and I’ll answer any questions you have. Can you get a beer from the fridge for me?” “Sure Dad – just a min.” Adam stepped out of his room and took a left down some steps to the atrium where there were potted ferns and a rustic farm table. A steel refrigerator with a hand carved rail handle was tucked underneath the staircase. He grabbed a beer and a coke, then tuna, pumpernickel bread and mayo. After quickly making the sandwiches, he set them on a plate with an extra plate underneath and tucked two napkins into his back pocket. With the drinks in his right hand and food in the left, he jogged up the opposite set of stairs to his father’s office. The door slid open automatically and Aiden pushed a rolling chair over to his son in welcome. “Thanks bud!” “Sure thing.” Adam shrugged it off. “I have to say Dad, this history of technology class is so weird. He started with the wheel in lesson one and we are already doing SBCs in three. Somewhere in lesson two things really sped up.” Aiden had a bite of tuna sandwich in his mouth. Swallowing thoughtfully, he took a sip of his beer. “Time has been like that. Things have been speeding up ever since I was born.” “Born. So weird, right? What does it mean anyway, to be born? It’s so arbitrary.” Adam picked up his coke and peered over it leaning back in his chair, anticipating that this comment would get a reaction from his dad. “I don’t think birth is arbitrary at all,” Aiden stammered, “And I don’t think life is arbitrary either. The difficult thing, legally … and technically, is agreeing on what the two have in common.” He had lost his appetite for tuna but was suddenly wanting a second beer as a backup in case the first one dried up too quick. He looked at his phone to see the time – 2pm. He frowned and looked up. “Why’d you do it Dad? I could have died, right?” “Really, the odds are quite good, and have been for quite some time, plus there are other benefits to traditional birth, for your mom. Have you asked her about it? She might be a better one to discuss these things with. You know she was the one who insisted it was the right thing when I was on the fence.” “Really?” Adam was surprised. He was aware that there had been some complications on her third birth, for his sister, Leila. “Does she regret not having Leila the safer way?” “We have no regrets son.” “Was it horrible? Is it?” Adam recalled the time he’d snuck into his father’s sound lab. No one knew it, but he had listened all the way to the end of track 45, with morbid curiosity, to know where all the suffering led. To Adam it had sounded like the worst kind of torture chamber he could imagine. With the last ecstatic scream, timed perfectly to the SBC crowning moment, the track transitioned to a Zen sighing sound that would be drowned out by the first cries of the baby. Without knowing why, he’d found himself curled up on the floor, weeping softly until the soundtrack of sighing noises subsided and the room became silent. “Did Professor Lawrence touch on the concept of ‘labor’”?&quot;, &quot;_html&quot;: &quot;&lt;p&gt; Aiden was disruptive, perhaps … not because he was innovative exactly,&lt;br&gt; but because he borrowed ideas from one industry and trademarked them&lt;br&gt; in another.

It’s&lt;br&gt; so arbitrary.” Adam picked up his coke and peered over it leaning&lt;br&gt; back in his chair, anticipating that this comment would get a reaction&lt;br&gt; from his dad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “I don’t think birth is arbitrary at all,” Aiden stammered, “And I&lt;br&gt; don’t think life is arbitrary either. The difficult thing, legally …&lt;br&gt; and technically, is agreeing on what the two have in common.” He had&lt;br&gt; lost his appetite for tuna but was suddenly wanting a second beer as a&lt;br&gt; backup in case the first one dried up too quick. He looked at his&lt;br&gt; phone to see the time – 2pm. He frowned and looked up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Why’d you do it Dad? I could have died, right?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Really, the odds are quite good, and have been for quite some time,&lt;br&gt; plus there are other benefits to traditional birth, for your mom. Have&lt;br&gt; you asked her about it? She might be a better one to discuss these&lt;br&gt; things with. You know she was the one who insisted it was the right&lt;br&gt; thing when I was on the fence.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Really?” Adam was surprised. He was aware that there had been some&lt;br&gt; complications on her third birth, for his sister, Leila. “Does she&lt;br&gt; regret not having Leila the safer way?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “We have no regrets son.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Was it horrible? Is it?” Adam recalled the time he’d snuck into his&lt;br&gt; father’s sound lab. No one knew it, but he had listened all the way&lt;br&gt; to the end of track 45, with morbid curiosity, to know where all the&lt;br&gt; suffering led. To Adam it had sounded like the worst kind of torture&lt;br&gt; chamber he could imagine. With the last ecstatic scream, timed&lt;br&gt; perfectly to the SBC crowning moment, the track transitioned to a Zen&lt;br&gt; sighing sound that would be drowned out by the first cries of the&lt;br&gt; baby. Without knowing why, he’d found himself curled up on the floor,&lt;br&gt; weeping softly until the soundtrack of sighing noises subsided and the&lt;br&gt; room became silent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Did Professor Lawrence touch on the concept of ‘labor’”?&lt;/p&gt;&quot;, &quot;metadata&quot;: b { &quot;@type&quot;: undefined, &quot;isBasedOnUrl&quot;: null, &quot;permalinkUrl&quot;: undefined, &quot;url&quot;: undefined, &quot;inLanguage&quot;: null, &quot;starred&quot;: true, &quot;inFeed&quot;: true, &quot;hasPage&quot;: false, &quot;inNav&quot;: false, &quot;_description&quot;: &quot;&quot;, &quot;_caption&quot;: undefined, &quot;title&quot;: undefined, &quot;keywords&quot;: List [], &quot;via&quot;: undefined, &quot;authors&quot;: undefined, &quot;publisher&quot;: undefined, &quot;coverPrefs&quot;: undefined, &quot;geo&quot;: undefined, &quot;address&quot;: undefined, &quot;hasMap&quot;: undefined }, &quot;cover&quot;: undefined, &quot;navigation&quot;: undefined, &quot;footer&quot;: undefined, &quot;link&quot;: undefined }" data-reactid="39"><p> Aiden was disruptive, perhaps … not because he was innovative exactly,<br> but because he borrowed ideas from one industry and trademarked them<br> in another.

Conservatives called it pornographic and disgusting; liberals<br> called it capitalistic, cliché, a laugh track; but couples continued<br> to request it as the soundtrack of choice for their birthing<br> experiences. But I must apologize. I am getting ahead of myself.<br><br> You see, Aiden played with electric cars as a child. Indeed, he was<br> fascinated by them and as an adolescent would pore over the car zines<br> on his iPad, learning every detail of the industry. As a teen he<br> began his own electric car video blog in which he did 45 second<br> summaries of the most recent innovations in electric car tech. After<br> one of his videos covering electric SUVs went viral, he caught the<br> attention of Vedra Industries who offered him a deal right out of high<br> school to be the official vlog for their new, all-electric sport<br> utility vehicle, the Vedra Climber. Aiden’s family, not being<br> wealthy, encouraged him to take the offer, which he did without<br> hesitation. So Aiden skipped college and went straight to work from<br> home, doing what he loved in a vlogging studio funded by Vedra. The<br> aha moment came when he began focusing on the cottage industry of<br> trademarked engine noises. Ever since the landmark court case in<br> which Valetti Auto had been forced to pay millions in settlements to<br> cover up the tragedy of the silent Valetti, electric car manufacturers<br> had turned to musicians, sound effects masters and voice actors to<br> create sound profiles for their vehicles that would meet a number of<br> human needs. Among them was of course safety, but no one really<br> wanted a siren on every vehicle. Traditionalists love a the throaty<br> sound of an engine, and most settled on some form of this sound for<br> their cars. There were some creative interpretations that were<br> publicly acceptable in the same fashion, perhaps, that creative cell<br> phone ring tones and car horns had been tolerated in the past. And<br> thanks to new technologies in sound trademarking, many small time<br> sound creators were effectively making a fortune off of just one good<br> track.<br><br> Right about that time there was also a breakthrough in home 3D<br> printing technologies. People had been printing prostheses,<br> prescription and illegal drugs, car parts, you name it, for quite some<br> time. The new frontier in 3D printing was in introducing new “inks”<br> and dimensions. It really wasn’t much of a leap for Dr. Jim Phelps,<br> of Johns Hopkins, to merge in vitro fertilization science with 3D<br> printing to create what he dubbed the synthetic birthing canal. This<br> “SBC” was initially seen by some as a step too far towards playing<br> God. And yet, there was a tremendous market for it. For one, risk to<br> the child and mother was infinitesimal. By contrast, traditional<br> birth carried with it all sorts of risks that eventually would become<br> tantamount to child or spouse abuse to even consider. If a mother or<br> father mentioned at a garden party that they were considering<br> traditional birth, they could anticipate awkward looks and in certain<br> regions, sometimes whispered slurs of “baby killer”. Traditional<br> births were therefore done in secret with the help of religious<br> communities who specialized in that sort of thing. An additional<br> benefit of the new technology is that it enabled couples to extend<br> gestation time for up to 21 months and thus meet legal requirements<br> for a termination of pregnancy much later than was traditionally<br> allowed. Women’s rights groups hailed this as an advancement, and<br> anti-abortion groups called it infanticide. The SBC also came with<br> attachments which allowed for a couple or group to “plug in” for a<br> procreation experience. This option spawned a whole new area of<br> obsession for some who saw the impregnation experience as something<br> that could or should be shared by a community. Some models of the SBC<br> could be worn in stylish front or back carriers so that the<br> anticipated birth could be celebrated with others. Like the electric<br> car, innovation was opening up new ways of sharing human experiences,<br> and in some cases people still wanted to have something of the past<br> included.<br><br> Aiden anticipated, rightly, as he saw the technology develop, that<br> there would be a market for a traditional human sound experience with<br> the SBC. A silent birth, to him, sounded just as unsettling as a<br> silent sports car. What most of them would want, he imagined, was not<br> the actual sounds of birth, at least not at first. They would want<br> some idealized version. It could probably be sampled from real birth<br> sounds, but would need to be reimagined and sanitized, by someone<br> untainted by the actual experience of having done it, by someone who<br> could imagine the perfect birth experience.<br><br> Aiden’s first foray into the idea of creating a birthing soundtrack<br> required visits to a few of the aforementioned religious communes,<br> where he sampled sounds from 72 births over the course of 15 months.<br> He was horrified at what he saw. The long hours of groaning, panting,<br> pleading, and weeping at once turned his stomach and rocked his<br> emotions. It changed him. It also changed his idea of what birth<br> should be. Real birth was an experience so far removed from the<br> modern world, where suffering and waiting had been nearly eliminated.<br> Women in these communes sometimes chose to undergo traditional<br> practices of “laboring”, a word that had become arcane to common<br> language.<br><br> After some manipulation, he came up with what he thought was the right<br> combination of anticipation leading to desperation, turning to agony,<br> ending in joy.

Ever heard the word “new-fangled”?

He touched the screen of the wall in front<br> of him.<br><br> “Dad?”<br><br> Aiden answered the call.<br><br> “What’s up Adam?”<br><br> Adam pushed back from his desk and swiveled to look across the house.<br> His father had done the same. They could see each other, about 50<br> feet apart across an open space, in separate glass rooms; and with the<br> call on, they could hear each other through the house speakers almost<br> more clearly than if they were in the same room.<br><br> “I just finished lesson three of HOT101 and they were talking about<br> you. I thought I knew all this stuff already, but it sounds weird<br> hearing it said like in one story, you know?”<br><br> “What do you mean?” Aiden’s head cocked to the side a bit. Adam<br> swiveled back to his desk so he could see his dad’s face on the screen.<br><br> “I just mean… I know the reasons why you said you did it, and more,<br> because we’ve talked about it before. Professor Lawrence seems to do<br> a pretty good job, I think, of getting some of the important stuff in<br> there. He said you were horrified, though. Was that right? Seems<br> kinda strong”<br><br> “Horrified? At what?” Aiden asked flatly. He already knew what Adam<br> might say and anticipated that this conversation would require more<br> energy than his workday should allow. He glanced away from his screen<br> at his phone which was buzzing on his knee with incoming tweets.<br><br> “At real birth.” Adam felt himself beginning to sweat. He hadn’t<br> really wanted to talk about it with his dad, but curiosity always<br> seemed to get the better of him when opportunities presented<br> themselves.<br><br> “Why did you and mom have me natural?” If it was so horrible, why did<br> you put her through that? I could have died, right?”<br><br> “Thank God you didn’t and thank God she didn’t.” Aiden looked into<br> the screen at his son’s eyes. “Come on over here. Let’s grab a<br> sandwich and I’ll answer any questions you have. Can you get a beer<br> from the fridge for me?”<br><br> “Sure Dad – just a min.”<br><br> Adam stepped out of his room and took a left down some steps to the<br> atrium where there were potted ferns and a rustic farm table. A steel<br> refrigerator with a hand carved rail handle was tucked underneath the<br> staircase. He grabbed a beer and a coke, then tuna, pumpernickel<br> bread and mayo. After quickly making the sandwiches, he set them on a<br> plate with an extra plate underneath and tucked two napkins into his<br> back pocket. With the drinks in his right hand<br> and food in the left, he jogged up the opposite set of stairs to his<br> father’s office. The door slid open automatically and Aiden pushed a<br> rolling chair over to his son in welcome.<br><br> “Thanks bud!”<br><br> “Sure thing.” Adam shrugged it off. “I have to say Dad, this history<br> of technology class is so weird. He started with the wheel in lesson<br> one and we are already doing SBCs in three. Somewhere in lesson two<br> things really sped up.”<br><br> Aiden had a bite of tuna sandwich in his mouth.

His first million came from a simple idea, trademarking a scream. Conservatives called it pornographic and disgusting; liberals called it capitalistic, cliché, a laugh track; but couples continued to request it as the soundtrack of choice for their birthing experiences. But I must apologize. I am getting ahead of myself. You see, Aiden played with electric cars as a child. Indeed, he was fascinated by them and as an adolescent would pore over the car zines on his iPad, learning every detail of the industry. As a teen he began his own electric car video blog in which he did 45 second summaries of the most recent innovations in electric car tech. After one of his videos covering electric SUVs went viral, he caught the attention of Vedra Industries who offered him a deal right out of high school to be the official vlog for their new, all-electric sport utility vehicle, the Vedra Climber. Aiden’s family, not being wealthy, encouraged him to take the offer, which he did without hesitation. So Aiden skipped college and went straight to work from home, doing what he loved in a vlogging studio funded by Vedra. The aha moment came when he began focusing on the cottage industry of trademarked engine noises. Ever since the landmark court case in which Valetti Auto had been forced to pay millions in settlements to cover up the tragedy of the silent Valetti, electric car manufacturers had turned to musicians, sound effects masters and voice actors to create sound profiles for their vehicles that would meet a number of human needs. Among them was of course safety, but no one really wanted a siren on every vehicle. Traditionalists love a the throaty sound of an engine, and most settled on some form of this sound for their cars. There were some creative interpretations that were publicly acceptable in the same fashion, perhaps, that creative cell phone ring tones and car horns had been tolerated in the past. And thanks to new technologies in sound trademarking, many small time sound creators were effectively making a fortune off of just one good track. Right about that time there was also a breakthrough in home 3D printing technologies. People had been printing prostheses, prescription and illegal drugs, car parts, you name it, for quite some time. The new frontier in 3D printing was in introducing new “inks” and dimensions. It really wasn’t much of a leap for Dr. Jim Phelps, of Johns Hopkins, to merge in vitro fertilization science with 3D printing to create what he dubbed the synthetic birthing canal. This “SBC” was initially seen by some as a step too far towards playing God. And yet, there was a tremendous market for it. For one, risk to the child and mother was infinitesimal. By contrast, traditional birth carried with it all sorts of risks that eventually would become tantamount to child or spouse abuse to even consider. If a mother or father mentioned at a garden party that they were considering traditional birth, they could anticipate awkward looks and in certain regions, sometimes whispered slurs of “baby killer”. Traditional births were therefore done in secret with the help of religious communities who specialized in that sort of thing. An additional benefit of the new technology is that it enabled couples to extend gestation time for up to 21 months and thus meet legal requirements for a termination of pregnancy much later than was traditionally allowed. Women’s rights groups hailed this as an advancement, and anti-abortion groups called it infanticide. The SBC also came with attachments which allowed for a couple or group to “plug in” for a procreation experience. This option spawned a whole new area of obsession for some who saw the impregnation experience as something that could or should be shared by a community. Some models of the SBC could be worn in stylish front or back carriers so that the anticipated birth could be celebrated with others. Like the electric car, innovation was opening up new ways of sharing human experiences, and in some cases people still wanted to have something of the past included. Aiden anticipated, rightly, as he saw the technology develop, that there would be a market for a traditional human sound experience with the SBC. A silent birth, to him, sounded just as unsettling as a silent sports car. What most of them would want, he imagined, was not the actual sounds of birth, at least not at first. They would want some idealized version. It could probably be sampled from real birth sounds, but would need to be reimagined and sanitized, by someone untainted by the actual experience of having done it, by someone who could imagine the perfect birth experience. Aiden’s first foray into the idea of creating a birthing soundtrack required visits to a few of the aforementioned religious communes, where he sampled sounds from 72 births over the course of 15 months. He was horrified at what he saw. The long hours of groaning, panting, pleading, and weeping at once turned his stomach and rocked his emotions. It changed him. It also changed his idea of what birth should be. Real birth was an experience so far removed from the modern world, where suffering and waiting had been nearly eliminated. Women in these communes sometimes chose to undergo traditional practices of “laboring”, a word that had become arcane to common language. After some manipulation, he came up with what he thought was the right combination of anticipation leading to desperation, turning to agony, ending in joy. It was created in blissful ignorance, but somehow managed to land directly on the bulls-eye of what people wanted. Couples would go in for their birth consult and be offered a catalogues of potential tracks to choose from, only to say in unison – “Aiden” which was slang for birth track 45 in the standard birth sound library. I am sorry to say that this is where we leave off for lesson three… I will see you again on Thursday at one pm for our next installment of “the history of technology” “vis-à-vis” … and yet “via” technology. Please pardon my silliness… I have a bit of a thing for good old fashioned words. Ever heard the word “new-fangled”? I love that one! See you soon Adam! The tweed and elbow pad clad tutor on the other end of the call visibly shook with a chuckle just a bit before the screen indicated he had hung up. “Dad?...” Adam leaned back in his chair and looked to his left to peer through an open door and two walls of glass to see his father’s office on the other side of the house. He touched the screen of the wall in front of him. “Dad?” Aiden answered the call. “What’s up Adam?” Adam pushed back from his desk and swiveled to look across the house. His father had done the same. They could see each other, about 50 feet apart across an open space, in separate glass rooms; and with the call on, they could hear each other through the house speakers almost more clearly than if they were in the same room. “I just finished lesson three of HOT101 and they were talking about you. I thought I knew all this stuff already, but it sounds weird hearing it said like in one story, you know?” “What do you mean?” Aiden’s head cocked to the side a bit. Adam swiveled back to his desk so he could see his dad’s face on the screen. “I just mean… I know the reasons why you said you did it, and more, because we’ve talked about it before. Professor Lawrence seems to do a pretty good job, I think, of getting some of the important stuff in there. He said you were horrified, though. Was that right? Seems kinda strong” “Horrified? At what?” Aiden asked flatly. He already knew what Adam might say and anticipated that this conversation would require more energy than his workday should allow. He glanced away from his screen at his phone which was buzzing on his knee with incoming tweets. “At real birth.” Adam felt himself beginning to sweat. He hadn’t really wanted to talk about it with his dad, but curiosity always seemed to get the better of him when opportunities presented themselves. “Why did you and mom have me natural?” If it was so horrible, why did you put her through that? I could have died, right?” “Thank God you didn’t and thank God she didn’t.” Aiden looked into the screen at his son’s eyes. “Come on over here. Let’s grab a sandwich and I’ll answer any questions you have. Can you get a beer from the fridge for me?” “Sure Dad – just a min.” Adam stepped out of his room and took a left down some steps to the atrium where there were potted ferns and a rustic farm table. A steel refrigerator with a hand carved rail handle was tucked underneath the staircase. He grabbed a beer and a coke, then tuna, pumpernickel bread and mayo. After quickly making the sandwiches, he set them on a plate with an extra plate underneath and tucked two napkins into his back pocket. With the drinks in his right hand and food in the left, he jogged up the opposite set of stairs to his father’s office. The door slid open automatically and Aiden pushed a rolling chair over to his son in welcome. “Thanks bud!” “Sure thing.” Adam shrugged it off. “I have to say Dad, this history of technology class is so weird. He started with the wheel in lesson one and we are already doing SBCs in three. Somewhere in lesson two things really sped up.” Aiden had a bite of tuna sandwich in his mouth. Swallowing thoughtfully, he took a sip of his beer. “Time has been like that. Things have been speeding up ever since I was born.” “Born. So weird, right? What does it mean anyway, to be born? It’s so arbitrary.” Adam picked up his coke and peered over it leaning back in his chair, anticipating that this comment would get a reaction from his dad. “I don’t think birth is arbitrary at all,” Aiden stammered, “And I don’t think life is arbitrary either. The difficult thing, legally … and technically, is agreeing on what the two have in common.” He had lost his appetite for tuna but was suddenly wanting a second beer as a backup in case the first one dried up too quick. He looked at his phone to see the time – 2pm. He frowned and looked up. “Why’d you do it Dad? I could have died, right?” “Really, the odds are quite good, and have been for quite some time, plus there are other benefits to traditional birth, for your mom. Have you asked her about it? She might be a better one to discuss these things with. You know she was the one who insisted it was the right thing when I was on the fence.” “Really?” Adam was surprised. He was aware that there had been some complications on her third birth, for his sister, Leila. “Does she regret not having Leila the safer way?” “We have no regrets son.” “Was it horrible? Is it?” Adam recalled the time he’d snuck into his father’s sound lab. No one knew it, but he had listened all the way to the end of track 45, with morbid curiosity, to know where all the suffering led. To Adam it had sounded like the worst kind of torture chamber he could imagine. With the last ecstatic scream, timed perfectly to the SBC crowning moment, the track transitioned to a Zen sighing sound that would be drowned out by the first cries of the baby.
