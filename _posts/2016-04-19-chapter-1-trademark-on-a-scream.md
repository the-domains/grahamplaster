As a teen he  began his own electric car video blog in which he did 45 second  summaries of the most recent innovations in electric car tech.

Among them was of course safety, but no one really  wanted a siren on every vehicle. Traditionalists love a the throaty  sound of an engine, and most settled on some form of this sound for  their cars. There were some creative interpretations that were  publicly acceptable in the same fashion, perhaps, that creative cell  phone ring tones and car horns had been tolerated in the past. And  thanks to new technologies in sound trademarking, many small time  sound creators were effectively making a fortune off of just one good  track.    Right about that time there was also a breakthrough in home 3D  printing technologies. People had been printing prostheses,  prescription and illegal drugs, car parts, you name it, for quite some  time. The new frontier in 3D printing was in introducing new “inks”  and dimensions. It really wasn’t much of a leap for Dr. Jim Phelps,  of Johns Hopkins, to merge in vitro fertilization science with 3D  printing to create what he dubbed the synthetic birthing canal. This  “SBC” was initially seen by some as a step too far towards playing  God. And yet, there was a tremendous market for it. For one, risk to  the child and mother was infinitesimal. By contrast, traditional  birth carried with it all sorts of risks that eventually would become  tantamount to child or spouse abuse to even consider. If a mother or  father mentioned at a garden party that they were considering  traditional birth, they could anticipate awkward looks and in certain  regions, sometimes whispered slurs of “baby killer”. Traditional  births were therefore done in secret with the help of religious  communities who specialized in that sort of thing. An additional  benefit of the new technology is that it enabled couples to extend  gestation time for up to 21 months and thus meet legal requirements  for a termination of pregnancy much later than was traditionally  allowed. Women’s rights groups hailed this as an advancement, and  anti-abortion groups called it infanticide. The SBC also came with  attachments which allowed for a couple or group to “plug in” for a  procreation experience. This option spawned a whole new area of  obsession for some who saw the impregnation experience as something  that could or should be shared by a community. Some models of the SBC  could be worn in stylish front or back carriers so that the  anticipated birth could be celebrated with others. Like the electric  car, innovation was opening up new ways of sharing human experiences,  and in some cases people still wanted to have something of the past  included.    Aiden anticipated, rightly, as he saw the technology develop, that  there would be a market for a traditional human sound experience with  the SBC. A silent birth, to him, sounded just as unsettling as a  silent sports car. What most of them would want, he imagined, was not  the actual sounds of birth, at least not at first. They would want  some idealized version. It could probably be sampled from real birth  sounds, but would need to be reimagined and sanitized, by someone  untainted by the actual experience of having done it, by someone who  could imagine the perfect birth experience.    Aiden’s first foray into the idea of creating a birthing soundtrack  required visits to a few of the aforementioned religious communes,  where he sampled sounds from 72 births over the course of 15 months.  He was horrified at what he saw. The long hours of groaning, panting,  pleading, and weeping at once turned his stomach and rocked his  emotions. It changed him. It also changed his idea of what birth  should be. Real birth was an experience so far removed from the  modern world, where suffering and waiting had been nearly eliminated.  Women in these communes sometimes chose to undergo traditional  practices of “laboring”, a word that had become arcane to common  language.    After some manipulation, he came up with what he thought was the right  combination of anticipation leading to desperation, turning to agony,  ending in joy. It was created in blissful ignorance, but somehow  managed to land directly on the bulls-eye of what people wanted.  Couples would go in for their birth consult and be offered a  catalogues of potential tracks to choose from, only to say in unison –  “Aiden” which was slang for birth track 45 in the standard birth sound  library.    I am sorry to say that this is where we leave off for lesson three… I  will see you again on Thursday at one pm for our next installment of  “the history of technology” “vis-à-vis” … and yet “via” technology.  Please pardon my silliness… I have a bit of a thing for good old  fashioned words. Ever heard the word “new-fangled”? I love that one!  See you soon Adam!    The tweed and elbow pad clad tutor on the other end of the call  visibly shook with a chuckle just a bit before the screen indicated he  had hung up.    “Dad?...”    Adam leaned back in his chair and looked to his left to peer through  an open door and two walls of glass to see his father’s office on the  other side of the house. He touched the screen of the wall in front  of him.    “Dad?”    Aiden answered the call.    “What’s up Adam?”    Adam pushed back from his desk and swiveled to look across the house.  His father had done the same. They could see each other, about 50  feet apart across an open space, in separate glass rooms; and with the  call on, they could hear each other through the house speakers almost  more clearly than if they were in the same room.    “I just finished lesson three of HOT101 and they were talking about  you. I thought I knew all this stuff already, but it sounds weird  hearing it said like in one story, you know?”    “What do you mean?” Aiden’s head cocked to the side a bit. Adam  swiveled back to his desk so he could see his dad’s face on the screen.    “I just mean… I know the reasons why you said you did it, and more,  because we’ve talked about it before. Professor Lawrence seems to do  a pretty good job, I think, of getting some of the important stuff in  there. He said you were horrified, though. Was that right? Seems  kinda strong”    “Horrified? At what?” Aiden asked flatly. He already knew what Adam  might say and anticipated that this conversation would require more  energy than his workday should allow. He glanced away from his screen  at his phone which was buzzing on his knee with incoming tweets.    “At real birth.” Adam felt himself beginning to sweat. He hadn’t  really wanted to talk about it with his dad, but curiosity always  seemed to get the better of him when opportunities presented  themselves.    “Why did you and mom have me natural?” If it was so horrible, why did  you put her through that? I could have died, right?”    “Thank God you didn’t and thank God she didn’t.” Aiden looked into  the screen at his son’s eyes. “Come on over here. Let’s grab a  sandwich and I’ll answer any questions you have. Can you get a beer  from the fridge for me?”    “Sure Dad – just a min.”    Adam stepped out of his room and took a left down some steps to the  atrium where there were potted ferns and a rustic farm table. A steel  refrigerator with a hand carved rail handle was tucked underneath the  staircase. He grabbed a beer and a coke, then tuna, pumpernickel  bread and mayo. After quickly making the sandwiches, he set them on a  plate with an extra plate underneath and tucked two napkins into his  back pocket. With the drinks in his right hand  and food in the left, he jogged up the opposite set of stairs to his  father’s office. The door slid open automatically and Aiden pushed a  rolling chair over to his son in welcome.    “Thanks bud!”    “Sure thing.” Adam shrugged it off. “I have to say Dad, this history  of technology class is so weird. He started with the wheel in lesson  one and we are already doing SBCs in three. Somewhere in lesson two  things really sped up.”    Aiden had a bite of tuna sandwich in his mouth. Swallowing  thoughtfully, he took a sip of his beer. “Time has been like that.  Things have been speeding up ever since I was born.”    “Born. So weird, right? What does it mean anyway, to be born? It’s  so arbitrary.” Adam picked up his coke and peered over it leaning  back in his chair, anticipating that this comment would get a reaction  from his dad.    “I don’t think birth is arbitrary at all,” Aiden stammered, “And I  don’t think life is arbitrary either. The difficult thing, legally …  and technically, is agreeing on what the two have in common.” He had  lost his appetite for tuna but was suddenly wanting a second beer as a  backup in case the first one dried up too quick. He looked at his  phone to see the time – 2pm. He frowned and looked up.    “Why’d you do it Dad? I could have died, right?”    “Really, the odds are quite good, and have been for quite some time,  plus there are other benefits to traditional birth, for your mom. Have  you asked her about it? She might be a better one to discuss these  things with. You know she was the one who insisted it was the right  thing when I was on the fence.”    “Really?” Adam was surprised. He was aware that there had been some  complications on her third birth, for his sister, Leila. “Does she  regret not having Leila the safer way?”    “We have no regrets son.”    “Was it horrible? Is it?” Adam recalled the time he’d snuck into his  father’s sound lab. No one knew it, but he had listened all the way  to the end of track 45, with morbid curiosity, to know where all the  suffering led. To Adam it had sounded like the worst kind of torture  chamber he could imagine. With the last ecstatic scream, timed  perfectly to the SBC crowning moment, the track transitioned to a Zen  sighing sound that would be drowned out by the first cries of the  baby. Without knowing why, he’d found himself curled up on the floor,  weeping softly until the soundtrack of sighing noises subsided and the  room became silent.    “Did Professor Lawrence touch on the concept of ‘labor’”?'

Draft of Chapter 1 for my forthcoming science fiction novella, "Labor"

# Chapter 1: Trademark on a Scream  

Aiden was disruptive, perhaps ... not because he was innovative exactly,  
but because he borrowed ideas from one industry and trademarked them  
in another. His first million came from a simple idea, trademarking a  
scream. Conservatives called it pornographic and disgusting; liberals  
called it capitalistic, cliché, a laugh track; but couples continued  
to request it as the soundtrack of choice for their birthing  
experiences. But I must apologize. I am getting ahead of myself.  
  
You see, Aiden played with electric cars as a child. Indeed, he was  
fascinated by them and as an adolescent would pore over the car zines  
on his iPad, learning every detail of the industry. As a teen he  
began his own electric car video blog in which he did 45 second  
summaries of the most recent innovations in electric car tech. After  
one of his videos covering electric SUVs went viral, he caught the  
attention of Vedra Industries who offered him a deal right out of high  
school to be the official vlog for their new, all-electric sport  
utility vehicle, the Vedra Climber. Aiden's family, not being  
wealthy, encouraged him to take the offer, which he did without  
hesitation. So Aiden skipped college and went straight to work from  
home, doing what he loved in a vlogging studio funded by Vedra. The  
aha moment came when he began focusing on the cottage industry of  
trademarked engine noises. Ever since the landmark court case in  
which Valetti Auto had been forced to pay millions in settlements to  
cover up the tragedy of the silent Valetti, electric car manufacturers  
had turned to musicians, sound effects masters and voice actors to  
create sound profiles for their vehicles that would meet a number of  
human needs. Among them was of course safety, but no one really  
wanted a siren on every vehicle. Traditionalists love a the throaty  
sound of an engine, and most settled on some form of this sound for  
their cars. There were some creative interpretations that were  
publicly acceptable in the same fashion, perhaps, that creative cell  
phone ring tones and car horns had been tolerated in the past. And  
thanks to new technologies in sound trademarking, many small time  
sound creators were effectively making a fortune off of just one good  
track.  
  
Right about that time there was also a breakthrough in home 3D  
printing technologies. People had been printing prostheses,  
prescription and illegal drugs, car parts, you name it, for quite some  
time. The new frontier in 3D printing was in introducing new "inks"  
and dimensions. It really wasn't much of a leap for Dr. Jim Phelps,  
of Johns Hopkins, to merge in vitro fertilization science with 3D  
printing to create what he dubbed the synthetic birthing canal. This  
"SBC" was initially seen by some as a step too far towards playing  
God. And yet, there was a tremendous market for it. For one, risk to  
the child and mother was infinitesimal. By contrast, traditional  
birth carried with it all sorts of risks that eventually would become  
tantamount to child or spouse abuse to even consider. If a mother or  
father mentioned at a garden party that they were considering  
traditional birth, they could anticipate awkward looks and in certain  
regions, sometimes whispered slurs of "baby killer". Traditional  
births were therefore done in secret with the help of religious  
communities who specialized in that sort of thing. An additional  
benefit of the new technology is that it enabled couples to extend  
gestation time for up to 21 months and thus meet legal requirements  
for a termination of pregnancy much later than was traditionally  
allowed. Women's rights groups hailed this as an advancement, and  
anti-abortion groups called it infanticide. The SBC also came with  
attachments which allowed for a couple or group to "plug in" for a  
procreation experience. This option spawned a whole new area of  
obsession for some who saw the impregnation experience as something  
that could or should be shared by a community. Some models of the SBC  
could be worn in stylish front or back carriers so that the  
anticipated birth could be celebrated with others. Like the electric  
car, innovation was opening up new ways of sharing human experiences,  
and in some cases people still wanted to have something of the past  
included.  
  
Aiden anticipated, rightly, as he saw the technology develop, that  
there would be a market for a traditional human sound experience with

sounds, but would need to be reimagined and sanitized, by someone  
untainted by the actual experience of having done it, by someone who  
could imagine the perfect birth experience.  
  
Aiden's first foray into the idea of creating a birthing soundtrack  
required visits to a few of the aforementioned religious communes,  
where he sampled sounds from 72 births over the course of 15 months.  
He was horrified at what he saw. The long hours of groaning, panting,  
pleading, and weeping at once turned his stomach and rocked his  
emotions. It changed him. It also changed his idea of what birth  
should be. Real birth was an experience so far removed from the  
modern world, where suffering and waiting had been nearly eliminated.  
Women in these communes sometimes chose to undergo traditional  
practices of "laboring", a word that had become arcane to common  
language.  
  
After some manipulation, he came up with what he thought was the right  
combination of anticipation leading to desperation, turning to agony,  
ending in joy. It was created in blissful ignorance, but somehow  
managed to land directly on the bulls-eye of what people wanted.  
Couples would go in for their birth consult and be offered a  
catalogues of potential tracks to choose from, only to say in unison --  
"Aiden" which was slang for birth track 45 in the standard birth sound  
library.  
  
I am sorry to say that this is where we leave off for lesson three... I  
will see you again on Thursday at one pm for our next installment of  
"the history of technology" "vis-à-vis" ... and yet "via" technology.  
Please pardon my silliness... I have a bit of a thing for good old  
fashioned words. Ever heard the word "new-fangled"? I love that one!  
See you soon Adam!  
  
The tweed and elbow pad clad tutor on the other end of the call  
visibly shook with a chuckle just a bit before the screen indicated he

"We have no regrets son."  
  
"Was it horrible? Is it?" Adam recalled the time he'd snuck into his

weeping softly until the soundtrack of sighing noises subsided and the  
room became silent.  
  
"Did Professor Lawrence touch on the concept of 'labor'"?

"He mentioned it.  But in my other history class we are studying 

labor camps, so, to be honest, I don't really see anything good in using

that word.  I mean, if it is good in any way, then it is the wrong

word for it, you know?"

  
"I know what you mean. Words are a bit slippery like that. They

don't always mean what they should."  Aiden took the last swig of his

beer and stared inwardly at the green bottle.

"Guys" ... the voice came from the walls.  "Have you guys eaten already?"

"Yeah mom," Adam said, a little louder than he needed to.  Despite the

clarity of the house intercom, his mom always tended to miss words

when they used it.  She said it was because she needed the human

connection -- to look people in the eye. That always made Adam shrug at 
her, in a semi-understanding and less than semi-caring manner. "We're 
having a man to man chat.... Dad says you might be a better one to ask 
about...uh, most of it."

Aiden smiled sheepishly at his son from behind his desk.

"Don't be hard on your dad, Adam" his mom's voice chimed in, leaving

little bandwidth for Adam's conscience within his internal dialogue.

"You can come over here and chat after I get your sister down for her

nap.  Or we can go for a walk if your dad doesn't mind keeping an ear

open for Leila."

"Yeah, sure.. no problem," said Aiden. "He's all yours."  He seemed

just a little relieved.

Adam laughed, "Can I get you another beer dad?"

"I'm, good... I'm just, well, you know, a little awkward about certain

things I guess"  He was looking past his son, through the window at

the top of a tree.  Light was shifting through the tree.

"I get it dad. You're introverted I think. I just don't understand why

an introvert would become a famous vlogger.  How did that happen?"

"I'm a maven I guess -- pretty good at going deep on a few things.

Those are the things I have a lot of confidence to talk about, and

then there are other things.... Things I don't know a lot about, but I

feel.... You know?  I feel a lot about them, without having a lot of

facts, and it makes it hard to talk about things.  I got so used to,

from a young age that is, used to talking about certain things with

authority... in my voice -- about electric cars and stuff.  And then the

SBC came along and I saw this opportunity ... like it was so obvious to

me .... Like it was a fact, and I just did it.  But then I met your mom"

"At the birthing center."

"Yes.  She was a holistic nurse.  She told me all this stuff that I

didn't know anything about, and I couldn't think it through.  There

were too many unknowns.  But I felt...."

"Felt what?"

"I felt...." Aiden stared at the light in the trees and seemed to be

lost for words.

"What dad"

"I just felt."

Just then a text appeared on the wall in a faint lime green.  It read:

"Leila is asleep, come over. we'll walk and talk"

"That's my cue!" Adam said with a grin and swiveled out of his chair

to his feet.

"OK bud ... I will see you a little later.  You know I really appreciate

you talking to me. A lot of sons don't talk to their dads like this."

"I know, right?" quipped Adam as he ducked out the door and bounded

away down the atrium steps.  His mother's office was on the other end

of the house, through the atrium on the first floor, down a cool blue

glass hallway decorated with 3D translucent water drops running down

the walls as though one were walking behind a waterfall.  The

background sound was a synthesis of rain storm, nightingales, loons

and distant thunder.  It was his mom's favorite motif for the first

floor when Leila was napping.  It made Adam want to find a corner and

lounge on a beanbag chair with a book. She was doing just that,

sitting outside the baby's room in a slipcovered loveseat, reading

Jane Eyre. Lisa looked up at her son with a seasoned smile.

"Let's go!"

"Mom, I do have a little work to do later, and another class this evening."

"On what?"

"Literary devices."

"Cool. Which ones?"

"Well, it isn't on the syllabus, but Prof. Panza says he wants to talk

to us about frametales."

"I haven't heard of that one," she said, with genuine interest.

"I'll let you know how it goes."  Adam shrugged his usual shrug.

"So, should we walk towards town, or do you want to get out a bit?"

Adam knew his mom always preferred to walk away from town. "Your pick" he said.

"I was thinking we could walk towards town, since I know you like to

stop in to Joz if we get that far."

"Well that would be awesome.  We'd have to walk quick to do that, get

in and out, and still make it back for my class." He knew she was

trying to soften him up, but he wasn't sure why.

They stepped out the back door of the house and through the back yard

which was was a small manicured plot with potted plants and

vegetables. The path they were on was a 20 foot slate walk leading to

a pedestrian track just beyond a white picket fence.  On the track,

cyclists and joggers were commuting in both directions, clad in tight

fitting athletic fabrics of all colors.  Predominantly the runners

wore silver and metallic blues, the colors of the Joz brand.  The

cyclists wore brighter colors, including pastels and neons with

angular patterns or social icons.  Hanging a left on the track, they...
